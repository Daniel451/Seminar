Paper Title: Deep Learning: Neural Networks for Object Detection and Tracking Tasks
Paper Author: Daniel Speck

A. Summary of the paper:
The paper gives an overview of how CNNs are constructed, their inner mathematical workings, the biologoical inspirations and lastly the present successes in using CNNs for recognition of different medias.

B. Strengths of the paper:
- explains a lot of related concepts clearly
- a comprehensible in-depth look into the mathematical roots of different CNN concepts

C. Weaknesses of the paper:
- some passages are a bit convoluted
- While I'm not against it, I don't know what the general opinion about referencing wikipedia is in academia
- could have split up the biological background into separate section
